puttygen-osx
============

XCode project for building PuTTYgen command line for Mac OS X.

https://github.com/eldridgegreg/puttygen-osx

This project simply packages the PuTTY 0.62 source in a convenient XCode project.  This eliminates the need for MacPorts or other make utilities.  I have also provided a binary distribution for those users who do not have Xcode or wish to compile themselves (see the Downloads tab).

The binary is 64 bit, and has only been tested (limitedly) on Mac OS X 10.7.4.  I am happy to provide other binary versions if requested, but cannot test on older Mac OS X version very easily.  If you run into any problems, please comment on github or email me at greg@desult.com, and I will do my best to help.
